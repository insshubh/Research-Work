## 📄 Abstract

The rise of DLT compliance in India's telecom sector has introduced both regulation and friction in digital communications. Businesses struggle with creating valid templates under TRAI’s DLT guidelines, resulting in high rejection rates and compliance delays. This thesis proposes **DLT GPT**, an AI-powered chatbot that automates and simplifies TRAI DLT compliance using **large language models (LLMs)** like **LLaMA** and **Google’s Gemini**, backed by a secure Flask-MongoDB infrastructure.

The system bridges the gap between users and regulatory frameworks, facilitating accurate message formatting, validation, and real-time error detection. It also supports WhatsApp API template formatting and JSON generation, making it highly adaptable to current marketing and communication trends.

## 📌 Introduction

TRAI introduced DLT to prevent spam and fraud in commercial communications. While the initiative is impactful, small businesses often face barriers due to technical constraints in formatting and approving message templates. Manual efforts are time-consuming and error-prone.

**DLT GPT** addresses this challenge by offering a chatbot interface to:
- Validate DLT templates
- Convert text to WhatsApp JSON templates
- Answer TRAI-related queries
- Offer 24/7 AI-powered guidance

## 📈 Impact & Industry Relevance

**DLT GPT** directly supports marketing teams, legal compliance departments, and digital communication managers. It helps:
- Reduce SMS/WhatsApp template rejections
- Accelerate approval cycles
- Ensure full compliance with evolving TRAI rules

**Real-world use case:**  
A small retail company used DLT GPT to launch a campaign with zero rejections and saved ~5 hours per week in manual corrections.

## 🔬 Literature Review

- **Twilio & Gupshup:** Excellent SMS delivery systems, but lack built-in DLT compliance.
- **Yellow.ai & Zendesk:** Support chatbot flows, but no telecom compliance logic.
- **Our Contribution:** Combines AI, regulation understanding, and automation in one deployable system.

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Voice-based template creation
- Regional language support
- Email + Push Notification DLT compliance
- Smart campaign scheduler with approval timelines
